# This config expects that the flake8-bugbear extension to be installed.
# bugbear looks at the line length and allows a slight variance as opposed
# to a hard limit.  When it detects excessive line lengths, it returns B950.
# This config looks for B950 and ignores the default flake8 E501 line length error.
